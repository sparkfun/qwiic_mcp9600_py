#
#   This example allows you to change the ADC resolution on the thermocouple (hot) and ambient (cold) junctions. Why
#   do this, you ask? Well, setting the resolution lower decreases the sampling time, meaning that you can measure
#   high-speed thermal transients! (at the expense of lower resolution, of course).

#   Before we start adjusting ADC resolution, a quick word on how this all works. All thermocouple systems have a hot
#   and cold junction, and the MCP9600 is no different. Thanks to physics, thermocouples only measure the difference
#   in hot and cold junction temperatures, meaning that in order to know the temperature of the hot junction, the
#   amplifier needs to know the temperature of cold junction. From there, it will add the cold junction temperature
#   to the temperature difference measured by the thermocouple, giving the absolute temperature rather than just the
#   relative one.

#   This means that the MCP9600 has to take two temperature measurements! Thankfully, the MCP9600 will let us set the 
#   resolution on each one independently. SetAmbientResolution and SetThermocoupleResolution configure these measurements
#   with a desired resolution for the cold and hot junctions respectively. 

#   Cold Junction Possible Resolutions:
#   kAmbientResolutionZeroPoint0625   -> Configures the ambient (cold) junction to measure in increments of 0.0625ºC
#   kAmbientResolutionZeroPoint25     -> Configures the ambient (cold) junction to measure in increments of 0.25ºC

#   Hot Junction Possible Resolutions: 
#   kThermocoupleResolution18Bit  -> Reads the hot junction ADC to 18 bits, or 2µV
#   kThermocoupleResolution16Bit  -> Reads the hot junction ADC to 16 bits, or 8µV
#   kThermocoupleResolution14Bit  -> Reads the hot junction ADC to 14 bits, or 32µV
#   kThermocoupleResolution12Bit  -> Reads the hot junction ADC to 12 bits, or 128µV

#   It's worth noting that since the thermocouple that serves as the hot junction is arbitrary, we can't provide a 
#   specification on how many degrees Celcius precision you will get for a given ADC resolution.
